First of all, I would like to thank the whole awesome HA-community. I've found so much inspiration from other awesome setups and handy tools for setting up my dashboard. Will also post these in her.

If you would like a setup like this, it would be handy if you already have HACS installed.

## Theme
IMPORTANT: To use themes from HACS you'll have to add some code to your configuration file.

For my GUI I've used the ios Dark theme (installed with HACS)
